# Copy SSH public key
There are two ways.

## Using `ssh-copy-id`
```
ssh-copy-id alias_name
```
## Copying manually
You can copy the public key manually to the remote server. The public key is usually located in `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`. Copy the content of the file and paste it in the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on the remote server.
