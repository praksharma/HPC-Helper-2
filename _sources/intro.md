A continuation of HPC Helper, now documenting ARCHER2, CSD3, and Cumulus. This repository builds upon the original [HPC Helper](https://sunbird.readthedocs.io/), which was written for [Sunbird](https://portal.supercomputing.wales/index.php/about-sunbird/). I finished my MSc and PhD, so my access to Sunbird was revoked. I still have access to Sunbird as of Feb 2025, but not for long.

* [ARCHER2](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/) – The UK's national supercomputing service.
* [CSD3](https://docs.hpc.cam.ac.uk/hpc/) – The Cambridge uni HPC cluster.
* [Cumulus](https://ukaeauk.sharepoint.com/sites/Cumulus/SitePages/Cumulus-2.aspx) – hosted at the MDC data centre at the UKAEA.
* [Friea](http://w3.freia.hpc.l/faq.html) - Very old, not used anymore. Hosted at UKAEA.

This docs is written in [Jupyter book](https://jupyterbook.org/) with [PyData Sphinx Theme](https://pydata-sphinx-theme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html).
