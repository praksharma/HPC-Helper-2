    "# SSH access restriction on compute nodes\n",
    "Cumulus has restricted SSH access to compute nodes. If you go to any compute node by running an interactive job, say `vis002`, you can see the output of the `/etc/security/access.conf`:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "(base) [zw5893@vis002 ~]$ grep -v '^#' /etc/security/access.conf\n",
    "+:root:ALL\n",
    "+:(cumulus_admin):ALL\n",
    "+:(cumulus_admin-memb):ALL\n",
    "-:ALL:ALL\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It means only `cumulus_admin` and `cumulus_admin-memb` can use SSH, and `-:ALL:ALL` blocks the remaining users.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if you try to login to `vis002` from a new terminal window, you will get the following error:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "(base) [zw5893@login1 ~]$ squeue -u $USER\n",
    "             JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER ST       TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)\n",
    "            159721     visio     bash   zw5893  R      23:53      1 vis002\n",
    "\n",
    "(base) [zw5893@login1 ~]$ ssh vis002\n",
    "Connection closed by 172.23.0.88 port 22\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Since SSH is restricted, this also prevents port forwarding of services like Jupyter, WandB, VS Code server etc. from the compute node to a personal PC.\n",
    "\n",
    "In most HPC systems, SSH access is allowed to compute nodes. The people who maintain the system said\n",
    "\n",
    "> This is quite deliberate.  If you need interactive access to the node you can use `srun`.  If you feel you really need this then please put in a ticket justifying the reason and we will discuss it within the HPC governance group and with the security team.\n"
